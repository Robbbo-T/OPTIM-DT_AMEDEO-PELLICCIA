## Regulatory Compliance

The OPTIM-DT framework is designed to support compliance with:

- **FAR Part 25** (US Transport Category Aircraft)
- **CS-25** (European Transport Category Aircraft)
- **ARP4754A** (Guidelines for Development of Civil Aircraft and Systems)
- **ARP4761** (Safety Assessment Process)
- **DO-178C** (Software Considerations in Airborne Systems)
- **DO-254** (Design Assurance Guidance for Airborne Electronic Hardware)

## Framework Compliance Features

### 1. Structured Development

- 11 canonical lifecycle phases align with certification requirements
- Traceability across all development phases
- Configuration management support
- Change control documentation

### 2. Systems Engineering

- Hierarchical breakdown structure (AMPEL → Segment → CA → CI)
- Requirements allocation and verification
- Interface management
- Verification and validation planning

### 3. Safety Assessment

- Systematic hazard analysis support
- Failure mode identification
- Common cause analysis
- Certification by analysis framework

## Certification Artifacts

The framework supports generation of key certification artifacts:

- **Requirements Documents** - Generated from CI specifications
- **Design Documents** - Structured by segment and CI
- **Verification Plans** - Aligned with lifecycle phases
- **Configuration Lists** - Complete CI traceability
- **Safety Assessment** - Hazard analysis documentation
